# Cloudflare Tunnel Setup - Complete Guide ðŸš€

## Why Cloudflare Tunnel?

Since your domain is already on Cloudflare, this is the **perfect solution**:

âœ… **100% Free** - No additional costs  
âœ… **Secure** - Encrypted tunnel, no open ports  
âœ… **Your Domain** - Use api.tcdb.uk  
âœ… **Integrated** - Everything in Cloudflare ecosystem  
âœ… **Fast** - Direct Cloudflare network connection  
âœ… **No VPS needed** - Run from your local machine  

## Architecture

```
User â†’ Cloudflare Worker â†’ Cloudflare Tunnel â†’ Your Local FastAPI
       (Edge proxy)         (Secure tunnel)     (localhost:8000)
```

**Everything stays in Cloudflare!**

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Restart Terminal

**IMPORTANT:** Close this PowerShell terminal and open a **NEW** one to refresh the PATH.

Then navigate back:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\aps33\Projects\tcdb-core
```

### Step 2: Verify cloudflared

```powershell
cloudflared --version
```

**If it doesn't work:**
```powershell
# Add to PATH for this session
$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\cloudflared"
cloudflared --version
```

**Still doesn't work?** Restart your computer (Windows needs this to update PATH).

### Step 3: Authenticate with Cloudflare

```powershell
cloudflared tunnel login
```

This opens your browser. Login to your Cloudflare account.

### Step 4: Create Tunnel

```powershell
cloudflared tunnel create tcdb-api
```

This creates a tunnel and shows output like:
```
Created tunnel tcdb-api with id abc123-def456-ghi789
```

**Copy the tunnel ID!**

### Step 5: List Tunnels (to get ID)

```powershell
cloudflared tunnel list
```

Output shows:
```
ID                                   NAME      CREATED
abc123-def456-ghi789                 tcdb-api  2025-10-09T06:00:00Z
```

Copy the ID from the first column.

### Step 6: Create Config File

Create file: `C:\Users\aps33\.cloudflared\config.yml`

```yaml
tunnel: abc123-def456-ghi789
credentials-file: C:\Users\aps33\.cloudflared\abc123-def456-ghi789.json

ingress:
  - hostname: api.tcdb.uk
    service: http://localhost:8000
  - service: http_status:404
```

**Replace `abc123-def456-ghi789` with YOUR tunnel ID!**

### Step 7: Route DNS

```powershell
cloudflared tunnel route dns tcdb-api api.tcdb.uk
```

This creates a CNAME record in your Cloudflare DNS pointing `api.tcdb.uk` to your tunnel.

### Step 8: Start FastAPI

**Terminal 1:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\aps33\Projects\tcdb-core
.\start-api.ps1
```

Keep this running!

### Step 9: Start Tunnel

**Terminal 2 (NEW terminal):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\aps33\Projects\tcdb-core
cloudflared tunnel run tcdb-api
```

Keep this running too!

### Step 10: Test

```powershell
# Test origin directly
curl https://api.tcdb.uk/descriptor/health

# Test through Cloudflare Worker
curl https://tcdb-edge.aps330.workers.dev/descriptor/health
```

## What Each Component Does

### 1. FastAPI Server (localhost:8000)
- Your TCDB API
- Runs locally on your machine
- Processes descriptor requests

### 2. Cloudflare Tunnel
- Secure encrypted connection
- Exposes localhost:8000 as api.tcdb.uk
- No open ports needed
- Free!

### 3. Cloudflare Worker (tcdb-edge)
- Edge proxy at 300+ locations
- Rate limiting (300 req/min)
- HMAC signing
- CORS headers
- Proxies to api.tcdb.uk

### 4. Your Domain (tcdb.uk)
- Already in Cloudflare
- DNS managed by Cloudflare
- SSL/TLS automatic

## Complete Flow

```
1. User makes request to:
   https://tcdb-edge.aps330.workers.dev/descriptor/compute

2. Cloudflare Worker receives it at edge (nearest location)
   - Checks rate limit
   - Adds HMAC signature
   - Adds CORS headers

3. Worker proxies to:
   https://api.tcdb.uk/descriptor/compute

4. Cloudflare Tunnel receives it
   - Decrypts secure tunnel
   - Forwards to localhost:8000

5. Your FastAPI processes request
   - Computes descriptors
   - Returns response

6. Response flows back through tunnel â†’ worker â†’ user
```

## Benefits of This Setup

âœ… **No VPS costs** - Everything runs locally  
âœ… **No Railway/Render** - Don't need third-party services  
âœ… **All Cloudflare** - Integrated ecosystem  
âœ… **Your domain** - Use api.tcdb.uk  
âœ… **Secure** - Encrypted tunnel  
âœ… **Fast** - Global edge network  
âœ… **Free** - $0 cost  

## Troubleshooting

### "cloudflared not found"

**Solution 1:** Close terminal, open NEW terminal  
**Solution 2:** Restart computer  
**Solution 3:** Add to PATH:
```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\cloudflared"
```

### "Tunnel already exists"

That's fine! Just use it:
```powershell
cloudflared tunnel list
cloudflared tunnel run tcdb-api
```

### "DNS not resolving"

Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS propagation. Check in Cloudflare dashboard:
- Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
- Select your domain (tcdb.uk)
- Click "DNS"
- You should see a CNAME record for `api` pointing to your tunnel

### "Connection refused"

Make sure FastAPI is running:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/descriptor/health
```

### "Worker returns 1016"

This means the tunnel isn't running or DNS hasn't propagated yet.

1. Check tunnel is running: `cloudflared tunnel info tcdb-api`
2. Check DNS: `nslookup api.tcdb.uk`
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation

## Monitoring

### View Tunnel Status
```powershell
cloudflared tunnel info tcdb-api
```

### View Tunnel Logs
The tunnel terminal shows live logs of all requests.

### View Worker Logs
```powershell
cd cloudflare/worker
wrangler tail
```

### Cloudflare Dashboard
- Tunnel analytics: https://one.dash.cloudflare.com
- Worker analytics: https://dash.cloudflare.com â†’ Workers
- DNS settings: https://dash.cloudflare.com â†’ Your domain â†’ DNS

## Running in Production

### Option 1: Keep Terminals Open
- Terminal 1: FastAPI
- Terminal 2: Tunnel

### Option 2: Run as Windows Service

Install tunnel as a service:
```powershell
cloudflared service install
```

Then it runs automatically on startup!

### Option 3: Use Task Scheduler

Create scheduled tasks to start:
1. FastAPI on boot
2. Tunnel on boot

## Cost Comparison

### Your Setup (Cloudflare Tunnel)
- **Cost:** $0
- **Bandwidth:** Unlimited
- **Requests:** 100k/day (free tier)
- **Locations:** 300+ edge locations

### Railway/Render Alternative
- **Cost:** $0-$5/month (free tier limited)
- **Bandwidth:** Limited on free tier
- **Requests:** Limited
- **Locations:** Single region

**Cloudflare Tunnel is clearly better for you!** âœ…

## Summary

You **don't need** Railway or Render because:

1. âœ… Your domain is already on Cloudflare
2. âœ… Cloudflare Tunnel is free
3. âœ… Everything stays in Cloudflare ecosystem
4. âœ… More secure (encrypted tunnel)
5. âœ… Faster (direct Cloudflare network)
6. âœ… No additional services needed

**Next step:** Close this terminal, open a NEW one, and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\aps33\Projects\tcdb-core
cloudflared --version
```

If that works, continue with the setup steps above!
