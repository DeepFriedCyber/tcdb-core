**Definition: Posterior Probability**

Computes posterior probability using Bayes' rule:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)

where P(E) = P(E|H) × P(H) + P(E|¬H) × P(¬H)

**Parameters**:
- `prior`: P(H) - prior probability of hypothesis
- `likeH`: P(E|H) - likelihood of evidence given hypothesis
- `likeNotH`: P(E|¬H) - likelihood of evidence given ¬hypothesis

**Returns**:
- Posterior probability P(H|E)

**Rust Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn posterior(prior: f64, ev: Evidence) -> Posterior {
    let numerator = ev.like_h * prior;
    let denominator = numerator + ev.like_not_h * (1.0 - prior);
    
    if denominator == 0.0 {
        0.5
    } else {
        numerator / denominator
    }
}
```

**Theorem: Supportive Evidence Increases Belief**

If evidence is more likely under H than ¬H (i.e., likeH > likeNotH),
then the posterior probability is greater than the prior.

**Mathematical Statement**:
For 0 < prior < 1 and likeH > likeNotH ≥ 0:
  posterior(prior, likeH, likeNotH) > prior

**Intuition**:
- If E is more likely when H is true, observing E should increase belief in H
- This is the fundamental property of Bayesian updating

**Rust Implementation**:
Verified by test: `posterior_updates_in_right_direction`

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Let p = posterior(prior, likeH, likeNotH)
2. p = (likeH × prior) / (likeH × prior + likeNotH × (1 - prior))
3. p > prior ⟺ likeH × prior > prior × (likeH × prior + likeNotH × (1 - prior))
4. ⟺ likeH > likeH × prior + likeNotH × (1 - prior)
5. ⟺ likeH × (1 - prior) > likeNotH × (1 - prior)
6. ⟺ likeH > likeNotH (since 1 - prior > 0)

**Theorem: Contradictory Evidence Decreases Belief**

If evidence is less likely under H than ¬H (i.e., likeH < likeNotH),
then the posterior probability is less than the prior.

**Mathematical Statement**:
For 0 < prior < 1 and 0 ≤ likeH < likeNotH:
  posterior(prior, likeH, likeNotH) < prior

**Theorem: Neutral Evidence Preserves Belief**

If evidence is equally likely under H and ¬H (i.e., likeH = likeNotH),
then the posterior equals the prior.

**Mathematical Statement**:
For 0 < prior < 1 and likeH = likeNotH:
  posterior(prior, likeH, likeNotH) = prior

**Rust Implementation**:
Verified by test: `neutral_evidence_preserves_prior`

**Proof**:
posterior(prior, likeH, likeH)
  = (likeH × prior) / (likeH × prior + likeH × (1 - prior))
  = (likeH × prior) / (likeH × (prior + 1 - prior))
  = (likeH × prior) / (likeH × 1)
  = prior

**Theorem: Posterior Bounds**

The posterior probability is always in [0, 1].

**Definition: Sequential Update**

    for ev in evidence {

**Theorem: Sequential Update Commutativity**

The order of independent evidence doesn't affect the final posterior.

**Mathematical Statement**:
For independent evidence E₁ and E₂:
  sequential_posterior(prior, [E₁, E₂]) = sequential_posterior(prior, [E₂, E₁])

**Rust Implementation**:
Verified by test: `sequential_update_order_matters`

**Note**: This assumes independence of evidence. If evidence is dependent,
order may matter.

**Theorem: Likelihood Ratio Interpretation**

The likelihood ratio determines the direction of belief update:

**Theorem: Bayes Factor Equals Likelihood Ratio**

For a single piece of evidence, the Bayes factor equals the likelihood ratio.

**Mathematical Statement**:
BF = LR = P(E|H) / P(E|¬H)

**Rust Implementation**:
Verified by test: `bayes_factor_interpretation`

**Proof Sketch**:
1. BF = [P(H|E) / P(¬H|E)] / [P(H) / P(¬H)]
2. By Bayes' rule: P(H|E) / P(¬H|E) = [P(E|H) / P(E|¬H)] × [P(H) / P(¬H)]
3. Therefore: BF = P(E|H) / P(E|¬H) = LR

**Theorem: Extreme Evidence Dominates Prior**
