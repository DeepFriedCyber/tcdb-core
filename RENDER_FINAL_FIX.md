# ✅ Render Build - FINAL FIX Applied

## The Root Cause

Render was detecting `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` in the **root directory** and trying to build the entire Python project (including numpy dependencies).

## The Solution

Set `rootDir: docs` in `render.yaml` so Render **ONLY** looks in the `docs/` folder, which contains:
- ✅ `index.html` (your homepage)
- ✅ `README.md` (documentation)
- ❌ NO Python files
- ❌ NO pyproject.toml
- ❌ NO dependencies to install

## Updated Configuration

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: tcdb-core-homepage
    env: static
    rootDir: docs          # ← KEY FIX: Only look in docs/
    buildCommand: ""       # ← No build needed
    staticPublishPath: .   # ← Serve everything in docs/
```

## What to Do Now

### Option 1: Trigger Redeploy (If Site Already Created)

1. Go to your Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your **tcdb-core** site
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** (top right)
4. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
5. Click **"Deploy"**

### Option 2: Delete and Recreate (Recommended)

Since the previous builds failed, it's cleaner to start fresh:

1. **Delete the old site:**
   - Go to your site in Render Dashboard
   - Click **"Settings"** tab (bottom left)
   - Scroll to bottom → **"Delete Web Service"**
   - Confirm deletion

2. **Create new site:**
   - Click **"New +"** → **"Static Site"**
   - Connect **tcdb-core** repository
   - Render will **automatically detect** the `render.yaml` configuration
   - Just click **"Apply"** then **"Create Static Site"**
   - That's it! No manual configuration needed.

### Option 3: Manual Configuration (If Auto-Detect Fails)

If Render doesn't auto-detect the configuration:

1. Click **"New +"** → **"Static Site"**
2. Connect **tcdb-core**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `tcdb-core`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Root Directory**: `docs` ← **IMPORTANT!**
   - **Build Command**: (leave empty)
   - **Publish Directory**: `.` (just a dot)
4. Click **"Create Static Site"**

## Expected Build Log

You should now see:

```
==> Cloning from https://github.com/DeepFriedCyber/tcdb-core...
==> Checking out commit 13f3fdb in docs directory
==> No build command specified
==> Uploading build...
==> Build successful 🎉
==> Deploying...
==> Your service is live 🎉
```

**No Python, no numpy, no errors!**

## Your Live URL

Once deployed, your site will be at:
**https://tcdb-core-[random].onrender.com**

You'll find the exact URL at the top of your Render dashboard page.

## What's on the Site

Your homepage showcases:
- ✅ **146 comprehensive tests** (56 Rust + 90 Python)
- ✅ **4 core modules**: Topological Signatures, Provenance Tracking, Data Proofs, Cross-Domain Reasoning
- ✅ **Complete TDD implementation** with property-based testing
- ✅ **Professional design** with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **API documentation** and code examples
- ✅ **Direct GitHub links**

## Why This Works

**Before:**
```
Repository Root
├── pyproject.toml     ← Render detected this
├── setup.py           ← And tried to build Python
├── docs/
│   └── index.html
```

**After:**
```
Repository Root (Render ignores this)
└── docs/              ← Render ONLY looks here
    ├── index.html     ← Just static HTML
    └── README.md      ← No Python files!
```

## Verification

After deployment succeeds, verify:

1. ✅ Site loads at your Render URL
2. ✅ Homepage displays correctly
3. ✅ All sections visible (hero, features, use cases, etc.)
4. ✅ GitHub links work
5. ✅ Responsive design works on mobile

## Auto-Deploy

From now on, whenever you update `docs/index.html` and push to GitHub:
1. Render automatically detects the change
2. Redeploys in ~30 seconds
3. Your site is updated!

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:

**Check Root Directory setting:**
- Must be exactly: `docs`
- Not: `./docs` or `/docs` or `docs/`

**Check Publish Directory:**
- Must be exactly: `.` (a single dot)
- Not: `./` or empty

### If you see 404 after deployment:

**Check the deployment log:**
- Look for "Uploading build..."
- Should show files being uploaded
- If no files uploaded, check Publish Directory

### If Render still tries to build Python:

**You may have created the site before the fix:**
- Delete the site completely
- Create a new one
- The new configuration will be used

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Verify the fix is in your repo
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: 13f3fdb Fix Render build - set rootDir to docs/

# Verify render.yaml
cat render.yaml
# Should show: rootDir: docs

# Verify docs/index.html exists
ls docs/index.html
```

## Summary

✅ **Root cause identified**: pyproject.toml in root directory
✅ **Fix applied**: Set `rootDir: docs` in render.yaml  
✅ **Changes pushed**: Commit 13f3fdb
✅ **Action needed**: Redeploy or recreate site on Render

This should **definitely** work now! The configuration tells Render to completely ignore the Python project and only serve the static HTML from the `docs/` folder.

Let me know once you trigger the redeploy and I can help verify it's working!
